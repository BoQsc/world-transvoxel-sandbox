# World Transvoxel 1.0.11-dev Operating Limits

## Qualified release matrix

The 1.0.11-dev S2 development build inherits the 1.0.9 Windows x86-64
qualification matrix, includes the documented 1.0.10-dev batched authoritative
sample query, and makes fade shader instance-parameter writes opt-in/default-off
so stable large-scale scenes do not exhaust Godot instance-shader storage. It is
qualified only for:

| Component | Supported value |
| --- | --- |
| Operating system | Windows 10/11 x86-64 |
| Godot | 4.6.3 and 4.7 |
| Runtime builds | `template_debug` and `template_release` |
| Renderer used by headless qualification | Compatibility |
| Native toolchain used to build release | Zig 0.16.0 |
| godot-cpp revision | `e83fd0904c13356ed1d4c3d09f8bb9132bdc6b77` |
| Terrain backend | official Transvoxel MIT backend |

Other platforms, architectures, and Godot versions are not qualified by this
release even if the source can be compiled for them.

Viewer capacity multiplied by demand capacity per viewer may not exceed
65,536. Deactivation distance must be at least activation distance.

## Geometry and world bounds

- Chunk cells per axis: 16.
- Stored samples per axis: 19, including fixed negative/positive padding.
- Maximum LOD: 20.
- Regular chunk: 49,152 vertices and 61,440 indices maximum.
- Each transition face: 3,072 vertices and 9,216 indices maximum.
- One chunk may own up to six transition faces.
- World manifest: 262,144 pages maximum.
- Manifest dependency records: 1,024 maximum; dependency text is 255 bytes.

## Storage, editing, and operations

- Common container size: 256 MiB maximum.
- Container section: 64 MiB maximum; 4,096 sections maximum.
- Production edit journal: 4,096 transactions, 65,536 commands, and 64 MiB.
- One edit transaction: 4,096 commands maximum.
- Runtime world-operation queue: 16 requests.
- One authoritative sample batch query: 4,096 grid points maximum.
- Side-by-side snapshot compaction: 4,096 pages and 256 MiB of source page
  bytes maximum.
- Storage CLI input: 1 GiB maximum, while common containers retain the
  stricter 256 MiB limit.
- Dense bake input is file-backed: finite-density validation uses a fixed
  1 MiB buffer, source sampling uses a 192 KiB explicit block cache, and one
  encoded page payload is retained at a time.
- Bake key and manifest metadata still scale with requested pages and remain
  bounded by the 262,144-page world-manifest limit.
- Schema-1 storage codec is `none`; compressed storage is not supported.

Compaction and migration never overwrite the live world. The output directory
must not exist, is published atomically after completion, and must be reopened
through a controlled stop/start before it becomes active.

## Operational requirements

- Runtime access is event-driven. Applications must send viewer updates when
  position or demand changes; there is no implicit scene viewer discovery.
- Keep viewer revisions monotonic and remove viewers when no longer active.
- Polling readiness is allowed, but signals and event-driven application code
  are preferred.
- Moving-viewer plan changes retain retiring render/collision chunks until the
  current replacement set is fully ready. During sustained movement, resource
  and application-record ownership can temporarily approach twice the active
  chunk capacity; it returns to the current desired set after streaming settles.
  Once replacements are fully ready, old chunk removal is capped at four chunks
  per frame to avoid a large one-frame dynamic LOD visual swap. Retiring render
  chunks remain render-only for 24 frames and fade out through native
  `GeometryInstance3D` transparency, optionally plus the per-instance shader
  parameter `wt_fade_opacity`; newly introduced render chunks fade in through
  the same 24-frame path. Same-key render mesh replacements keep the previous mesh as a
  temporary render-only retiring instance while the replacement mesh fades in,
  so replacement generation application does not swap the visible mesh at full
  opacity. Custom terrain shaders that want deterministic native fade behavior
  through `ALPHA` must declare an instance uniform named `wt_fade_opacity` with
  default `1.0`, apply it to `ALPHA`, and explicitly enable
  `WorldTransvoxelConfig.shader_fade_parameter_enabled`. This switch is off by
  default because Godot retains per-instance shader-parameter slots after use;
  stable large-scale scenes must keep the default unless the project has a
  measured shader-slot budget. Collision is removed at retirement.
- Authoritative sample queries can fail for absent, corrupt, misaligned, or
  disagreeing overlapping pages.
- Output paths for bake, migration, and compaction must not already exist.
- Python 3.11 or newer is required only for packaged command-line/editor tools,
  not for runtime terrain use.
