# Current Project Status

This file is the short-form tracker. It exists to prevent the project from
turning into an endless stream of small unrelated decisions.

## Active operating rule

Follow `docs/TERRAIN_ACCEPTANCE_STANDARD.md`.
Runtime scale budgets are governed by `docs/TERRAIN_RUNTIME_BUDGETS.md`.

Performance-sensitive terrain work belongs in native code, shaders/compute
when justified, binary formats, or Python offline tooling. GDScript is glue for
Godot scene scaffolding, input routing, debug UI, and headless test harnesses.
It is not where terrain generation, meshing, large-map streaming policy,
storage, recovery, fluids, or stability algorithms should live.

## Current milestone

S2 - chunked generation and scale ladder.

S0 is complete for the 128 baseline. S1 still has a visual blocker: dynamic
mixed-LOD popping is not accepted as seamless. We are not starting GPU compute,
water/lava, planets, structural collapse, a game repository, or 0BSD backend
replacement work before larger terrain behavior is measured.

## Latest evidence

S2.7 - L3 1024 generation preflight is complete for generation-only evidence.

Command:

```console
python tools/scale_ladder.py --level L3 --force
```

Result:

- horizontal cells: 1,024;
- vertical cells: 64;
- dimensions: 1,029 x 69 x 1,029 samples;
- LOD0 chunks: 64 x 4 x 64;
- pages: 18,432;
- generation seconds: 642.484;
- scale-ladder elapsed seconds: 642.719;
- stable world payload bytes: 764,449,679;
- source samples: 73,060,029;
- volumetric columns: 143,831;
- resource preflight: 2,020,323,328 free bytes, 1,881,200,750 required
  bytes including a 512 MiB safety reserve, and 2,872,004,608 available
  memory bytes;
- warning recorded: disk headroom was below 256 MiB above the conservative
  generation estimate before the run;
- world hash:
  `6c2ae9110f18fbc480a35308850ed97f981b155c7767e130a9b552de9f05e09d`;
- proven: Python generation, native bake tool, storage validation;
- not proven: Godot startup, movement/render/collision coverage, visual
  artifact acceptance, edit latency, or L4 2048 scale support.

S2.6 - L2 visual capture and artifact classification is complete for
automated static visual evidence.

Command:

```console
python tools/scale_visual.py --level L2
```

Result:

- engine: Godot 4.7 graphical mode;
- runtime budget: L2 staged movement profile with active chunk capacity 1,024;
- captures: 7 images under `artifacts/scale_ladder/L2/visual`;
- capture ranges: overview/material 0.626, LOD 0.639, top 0.077, tunnel
  0.773, boundary/material boundary 0.434;
- fixed during this step: the first L2 tunnel capture placed the camera too
  close to the tunnel wall and produced a large clipped wall plane, so the
  tunnel camera now follows the generated L2 tunnel centerline;
- classified: overview surface is upright and nonblank;
- classified: top view has no old side-band symptom, but remains low-detail
  because the current procedural terrain material is flat;
- classified: finite boundary shell is expected in boundary captures;
- classified: LOD color partitioning is expected in LOD debug captures;
- classified: underground tunnel is visible after centerline reframing;
- proven: representative L2 static visual captures were produced and every
  capture had nonblank viewport range;
- not proven: human visual acceptance, dynamic seamless LOD appearance, fast
  travel or disjoint teleport movement, or 1024/2048 scale support.

S2.5 - L2 runtime acceptance path is complete for headless runtime evidence.

Command:

```console
python tools/scale_runtime.py --level L2
```

Result:

- engines: Godot 4.6.3 and 4.7;
- L2 runtime budget: active chunk capacity 1,024;
- positions: 5 staged positions;
- probes: 25 render/collision probes per engine;
- minimum rendered chunks: 176;
- minimum collision chunks: 176;
- Godot 4.6.3: startup 129 ms, settle 2,905 ms, edit 619 ms;
- Godot 4.7: startup 149 ms, settle 2,966 ms, edit 654 ms;
- edit density delta: 6.0;
- maximum pending retirements: 0;
- classified during this step: the original L2 audit failed with the default
  512 active/change capacity because L2 movement can replace most of a 294
  chunk active set and exceed the delta budget; L2 runtime acceptance therefore
  uses an explicit 1,024 active chunk capacity;
- locked during this step: runtime budgets are now first-class acceptance data
  in `docs/TERRAIN_RUNTIME_BUDGETS.md` and are checked by
  `python tools/runtime_budget_profiles.py --check`;
- proven: Godot startup, staged movement render/collision coverage, one
  density edit/remesh, clean shutdown;
- not proven: visual artifact acceptance, dynamic seamless LOD appearance,
  fast travel or disjoint teleport movement, or 1024/2048 scale support.

S2.4 - L2 512 generation preflight is complete for generation-only evidence.

Command:

```console
python tools/scale_ladder.py --level L2 --force
```

Result:

- horizontal cells: 512;
- vertical cells: 64;
- dimensions: 517 x 69 x 517 samples;
- LOD0 chunks: 32 x 4 x 32;
- pages: 4,608;
- generation seconds: 150.745;
- scale-ladder elapsed seconds: 150.998;
- stable world payload bytes: 191,113,103;
- source samples: 18,442,941;
- volumetric columns: 37,026;
- warnings: none reported by the scale-ladder tool;
- world hash:
  `1d1e27ad6ca9521229e2a4c14693150cd64e214d63cae6d628b3ee6f06da6ad4`;
- proven: Python generation, native bake tool, storage validation;
- not proven: Godot startup, movement/render/collision coverage, visual
  artifact acceptance, edit latency, dynamic seamless LOD appearance, or
  1024/2048 scale support.

S2.3 - L1 visual capture and artifact classification is complete for automated
visual evidence.

Command:

```console
python tools/scale_visual.py --level L1
```

Result:

- engine: Godot 4.7 graphical mode;
- captures: 7 images under `artifacts/scale_ladder/L1/visual`;
- capture ranges: overview/material/LOD 0.701, top 0.088, tunnel 0.749,
  boundary/material boundary 0.443;
- fixed during this step: L1 graphical capture originally exceeded the GL
  compatibility shader instance-variable limit, so LOD debug coloring now uses
  per-LOD material copies instead of per-instance shader parameters;
- fixed during this step: L1 overlay/bounds reporting still assumed a 128 map,
  so debug UI now reads active world bounds;
- classified: finite boundary shell is expected in boundary captures;
- classified: LOD color partitioning is expected in LOD debug captures;
- not proven: human visual acceptance, dynamic seamless LOD appearance, or
  512/1024/2048 scale support.

S2.2 - L1 runtime acceptance path is complete for headless runtime evidence.

Command:

```console
python tools/scale_runtime.py --level L1
```

Result:

- engines: Godot 4.6.3 and 4.7;
- positions: 5 staged positions;
- probes: 25 render/collision probes per engine;
- minimum rendered chunks: 97;
- minimum collision chunks: 97;
- Godot 4.6.3: startup 222 ms, settle 3,331 ms, edit 514 ms;
- Godot 4.7: startup 119 ms, settle 3,107 ms, edit 513 ms;
- edit density delta: 6.0;
- proven: Godot startup, staged movement render/collision coverage, one
  density edit/remesh, clean shutdown;
- not proven: visual artifact acceptance, dynamic seamless LOD appearance, or
  512/1024/2048 scale support.

  `fb10bfa47bc7530a78a41791c155599e3d4e9a7a1a070aea4dcf6acd2a01084b`;
- proven: Python generation, native bake tool, storage validation;
- not proven: Godot startup, movement/render/collision coverage, visual
  artifact acceptance, edit latency, or 512/1024/2048 scale support.

## Current active task

S2.8 - L3 runtime budget planning.

Scope:

- do not copy the L2 runtime budget into L3 by assumption;
- define the L3 movement class, radius, maximum LOD, active chunk capacity,
  inherited cache budgets, and explicit overrides;
- derive a safe initial budget from L2 measured demand and replacement
  behavior before running Godot;
- keep L3 runtime support unclaimed until the planned profile passes the
  supported Godot engine matrix.

Exit:

- `docs/TERRAIN_RUNTIME_BUDGETS.md` contains a provisional L3 profile and
  rationale;
- `python tools/runtime_budget_profiles.py --check` enforces that profile;
- no GDScript performance logic is added.

## Next finite steps

1. Define and validate the provisional L3 runtime budget.
2. Add L3 runtime audit support using that explicit profile.
3. Run L3 headless startup/movement/collision/edit acceptance.

## Deferred by rule

- compute shaders;
- water and lava;
- planetary terrain;
- structural collapse;
- timed regeneration;
- small-game repository;
- independent 0BSD backend replacement.
